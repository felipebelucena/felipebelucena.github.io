Hello World! I'm Felipe Lucena, a computer Science Bachelor at UNICAP and currently working at C.E.S.A.R, developing desktop and mobile systems. C.E.S.A.R (Recife center for advanced studies and systems) is an Information, Technology and Communication private institute located in Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil.

The main goal with this blog is to share a little of the experience I've adquired via tutorials and maybe some non-tech posts. As a side effect I expect to develop my english writing =].
