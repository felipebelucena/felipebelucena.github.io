Hello World! I'm Felipe Lucena, a Computer Science Bachelor at UNICAP and currently working at C.E.S.A.R as a JR System Engineer, developing desktop and mobile systems. C.E.S.A.R (Recife center for advanced studies and systems) is an Information, Technology and Communication private institute located in Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil.

The main goal with this blog is to share a little tips and tutorials regarding system engineer in general. Maybe some non-tech posts also. As a side effect I expect to develop my english writing =].
