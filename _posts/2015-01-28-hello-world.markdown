Hi!

This blog is about sharing some knownledge adquired in my day-to-day as a system engineer. I expect to post some tips about developing systems (mobile in special, but not limited to) in a linux environment. I'd like to blog about non-tech stuff too, but let's see how it goes. That's it, hope you enjoy it.
