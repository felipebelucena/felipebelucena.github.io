In this post I'll show how I create this blog using Jekyll and Github Pages.

# What's Github Pages?

The first time I came across [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was when I was doing a college essay about the Nagios network monitoring software. I was looking for a simple way to host a page, as the teacher asked the students to put the essay online. So I found out that Github let's you host html pages for free. To doing this, you simply need to create an repository as you normally would but with the name in a specific format: "<your github user name>.github.io.".
